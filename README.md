# Rythm
We all run on a 24-hour internal “clock,” referred to as our circadian rhythm. 
This dictates when we go to sleep, wake up, and experience peak levels of energy. 

Within that 24-hour day, we cycle through 90-minute blocks of productivity and heightened focus, known as our ultradian rhythm. Refer to the blog based on which this app is conceptualized.
